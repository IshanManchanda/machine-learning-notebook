# Machine Learning Workbook

Personal practice repository for the Machine Learning course
on Coursera taught by Prof. Andrew Ng.

The repository contains, along with solutions for the
assignments, my own implementations of several ML
algorithms that were made to test my understanding of the
maths behind each algorithm.
